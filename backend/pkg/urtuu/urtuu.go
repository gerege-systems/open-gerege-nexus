 * Package urtuu is what two Gerege Nexus installations say to each other when
 * one hands the other a piece of work.
 *
 * Өртөө — the relay-post network of the Mongol Empire. A dispatch was carried
 * from post to post, each one acknowledging what it took, and the answer came
 * back the same way. The shape of the problem has not changed: an installation
 * accepts a task, either settles it or passes it on, and reports back up.
 *
 * This package is the contract and nothing else — no database, no HTTP, no
 * configuration. It is here rather than in `internal/` for the reason
 * `pkg/catalog` is: every distribution (gov, commerce, …) has to agree on what
 * an envelope is down to the byte, and a type they cannot import is a type they
 * will each reinvent slightly differently.
 *
 * The transport that carries these lives in internal/workspace/urtuu; the task
 * lifecycle built on them is the Өртөө app, internal/apps/urtuu.
