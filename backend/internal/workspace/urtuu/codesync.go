 * Reading what arrived, and the first thing that reads it.

 * The inbox is written by the transport and drained here. Kinds are dispatched
 * to whoever registered for them: the vocabulary announcement is this package's
 * own, and the task envelopes belong to the Өртөө app, which registers for them
 * when it is compiled in. An envelope of a kind nobody claims is left
 * unprocessed rather than discarded — a build that does not know a kind is not
 * evidence that the message was worthless, and the app being installed later is
 * exactly the case that has to keep working.
