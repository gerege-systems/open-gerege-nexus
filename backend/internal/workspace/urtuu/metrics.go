 * No tenant label on any of it — the rule this platform set in its first
 * monitoring phase and has kept (see internal/kernel/telemetry/business.go
 * for the argument). A label whose values are organisations is a series count
 * that only grows, and the per-organisation view is a reporting question
 * answered from the database, where a row can be deleted.
 *
 * These live here rather than in telemetry/business.go for the reason
 * written there about invoices: a metric named after a domain belongs to the
 * code that knows when the thing happened. A deployment that does not run
 * Өртөө exports nothing rather than a permanent zero.
