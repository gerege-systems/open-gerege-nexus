 * Package urtuu carries signed work between two Gerege Nexus installations.
 *
 * It is the transport half of Өртөө: links, the outbound queue, delivery with
 * retry, and идемпотент receipt. What the messages *mean* — tasks, their
 * lifecycle, the screens — is the Өртөө app in internal/apps/urtuu. The split
 * is the one the proposal draws (§3): the channel is infrastructure any module
 * may reach for, the task board is a product a tenant chooses to install.
 *
 * Two rules shape everything here.
 *
 * The child connects, never the parent (§2.1). A subordinate installation may
 * be behind a firewall, on a private network, or switched off for a week; a
 * parent that had to reach it would have a link that works only from one side
 * of the network. So the child polls for what is waiting and pushes what has
 * happened, and the parent's half of the conversation is a queue it holds until
 * somebody comes for it. The catalogue sync chose pull for the same reason.
 *
 * A token says who is speaking; a signature says who wrote it (§2.2). They are
 * different questions and both are asked on every envelope. A stolen token gets
 * an attacker a conversation and no ability to author anything in it; a forged
 * envelope does not survive the public key exchanged when the link was made.
